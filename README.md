Unit Testing for C

C is very difficult to test because portable mocking is difficult using only C. This project is made to make Unit testing C easier without needing scripts to generate code or a diffent compiler. It is purely written in C and heavily utilizes the preprocessor in order to mock functions.

This is still a work in progress.
